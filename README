Purpose
-------

	This library implements homomorphic integer comparison and it uses
the homomorphic ntru library which can be downloaded from here 
http://ecewp.ece.wpi.edu/wordpress/vernam/projects/source-codes/homomorphic-aes-evaluation-using-ltv/.
Homomorphic integer comparison can be used for the selection of the maximum from a vector, to sort
a vector or for Private Information Retrieval.


Setup
-----
	Library NTL 6.0
	Library gmp 5.1.3. 
	Doroz, Berk, Sunar Library which can be downloaded from here
http://ecewp.ece.wpi.edu/wordpress/vernam/projects/source-codes/homomorphic-aes-evaluation-using-ltv/

	After downloading the Doroz et.al library rename the folder of the library 
Hom_NTRU_library and copy it in the folder hom_int. 



References
----------
	The library uses the scenario described in 
"On-the-Fly Multiparty Computation on the Cloud via Multikey Fully Homomorphic Encryption" by Lopez-Alt et.al
https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/094 to compare homomorphically encrypted integers and select the maximum.
	For implementation the library uses the ideas and source code from 
"Comparison-based Applications for Fully Homomorphic Encrypted Data" by Togan et.al.
